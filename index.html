                <p>
                    There's no hood like motherhood.... or something like that.<br />
                    On September 9th, 2021, I was in Kuwait and went to the doctor<br />for something unrelated to pregnancy. After all, I was overseas<br />on a restricted tour, and there
                    was no way in heck I was pregnant.<br />I had to take a pregnancy test before I left the U.S., and my results<br />were negative. That, coupled with having no symptoms, lead
                    me<br />to believe I was safe. I couldn't have been more wrong....

                    Not only was I pregnant, I was 13 weeks pregnant...<br />A whole trimester complete! I went into shock at<br />the clinic and could not
                    contain myself. What was I<br />going to do? What was my unit going to say?

                Fast forward to today, the Army was able to send me back<br />to the U.S. safely and just in time to see a doctor.<br />Because there are no obstetricians in Kuwait,<br />
                I did not see one until I was halfway through my pregnancy.<br />Thankfully, my results came back normal and I am just<br />3 weeks away from meeting my little surprise baby.
                <br />As for my unit, I was blessed to have supportive leadership<br />who cared about my safety and getting me back to the U.S.<br />Although it threw a curveball in my career,
                <br />they took care of me and took measures to protect me.
